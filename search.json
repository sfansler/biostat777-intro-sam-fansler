    "text": "Biography\nI attended my undergraduate at Butler University with a double major in Statistics and Music. While at Butler, I combined my passions for music and statistics by completing a research project in the Indianapolis community. For this project, I worked with the Psychology department to implement a music intervention for dementia patients at a local nursing home. The goal of the project was to see if listening to a personalized playlist of music for one hour would improve older adults’ dementia-caused sundowning symptoms, both short-term (same day) and long term (across 3 months). This experience instilled a passion for research in public health, especially among the older adult population.\nAfter graduating from Butler, to further pursue my newfound passion, I pursued my Master’s degree in Biostatistics from the University of Michigan. During my Master’s, I continued my research by collaborating with the Epidemiology department to implement machine learning techniques to predict cardiovascular disease mortality using environmental metal mixtures. At Michigan, I learned the technical skills required to be a practicing Biostatistician and developed a solid theoretical foundation to continue my education.\nI am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in the Biostatistics department at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. At Hopkins, I hope to develop and improve methodology for measuring biomarkers and physical activity using wearable devices and imaging technology, especially for older adults.\nAfter completing my education, I hope to lead research in the field of wearable devices and mobile health, developing new rigorous statistical methodology and paving the way for application of cutting-edge technology to improve public health outcomes for older adults as well as the general population."

    "text": "Methods\nThe study population in this study included adults aged 65+ in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). NHANES is a cross-sectional survey taken in cycles every two years. It uses weighted examination and questionnaire data to obtain a representative comprehensive overview of the U.S. population. (“Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey Questionnaire. Hyattsville, MD: National Center for Health Statistics; 2022.” n.d.) This study used the 2013-2014 cycle of NHANES because that was the most recent cycle in which both cognitive functioning and alcohol use were measured. The outcome variable used was the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) score, which is a cognitive test that scores participants on a scale of 0 (worst) to 133 (best). Alcohol use was self-reported as “Average number of alcohol drinks per day in the past 12 months”.\nIn the first model, I performed a multiple linear regression of cognition on depression adjusting for demographic variables including age, race, sex, and education to see if my findings matched those previously found. My second model included an interaction term for depression and sex, to see if the effect of depression on cognition differs between sexes.\nThe data for the cognition and depression variables can be found here.\nThe data for the demographic variables can be found here."

However, I found that this association is not modified by sex. These results may be biased due to the deletion of missing observations, since it is possible that those with missing data for alcohol-use were likely to drink more than those with observed values. It is also possible that those with missing DSST scores were likely to do worse on the DSST, or have higher alcohol consumption than those with observed values. Finally, the survey weighting for NHANES was not used in this analysis for simplicity purposes of the analysis, as well as the consequence of a complete-case analysis. These results are meant to serve as preliminary findings for the lack of effect modification between sex and alcohol use to predict cognition among older adults."
